        This tool uses a deep learning model to predict the type of fruit or vegetable in an image you upload.
        It's designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use ‚Äî just exploring computer vision technology.

        To get started, navigate to the **Predict** tab and upload an image of a fruit or vegetable.

        This Fruit and Vegetable Classification System uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify various fruits and vegetables from images.
        The goal is to support quick and accurate food recognition, which can be useful in applications such as:
        
        - Automated checkout systems in grocery stores
        - Dietary tracking and food logging apps
        - Educational tools for kids to learn about healthy foods
        - Agricultural produce classification

        The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of common fruits and vegetables to ensure high prediction accuracy.
        Upload an image, and the system will classify it in real-time with its corresponding label.
